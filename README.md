# Stiltzkins-Bag
ffix randomizer assistant
Welcome to Stiltzkin's Bag 1.0 !




I adore Hades Workshop by Tirlititi, but I noticed several missing features. Always best to do the work for yourself right?

This tool requires you have Moguri installed to use.

Features:

~~ Randomize Item Shop Items ~~
~~ Randomize Sythesis Items ~~
~~ Randomize Character Base stats ~~
~~ Randomize Character Starting Equipment ~~
~~ Randomize Ability Gems costs ~~



~~ Seed functions - share or race with friends using exact same randomized settings ~~
~~ No spoilers - no preview of changes   ~~
~~ Auto Locate FF9 for the lazy, i mean classy  ~~
~~ debug string in case you ever need help ~~
~~ Style   ~~




Features Planned
~~ option to use existing files in output, currently only possible from stock data within program  ~~
