I adore Hades Workshop by Tirlititi, but I noticed several missing features. Always best to do the work for yourself right?

This tool requires you have Moguri installed to use.

Features:

~~ Randomize Item Shop Items ~~
~~ Randomize Sythesis Items ~~
~~ Randomize Character Base stats ~~
~~ Randomize Character Starting Equipment ~~
~~ Randomize Ability Gems costs ~~
